# Human Body Shape Estimation
Estimating Body Shape using 2D images. In our first iteration, we are building on the work of Choutas et al., using their SHAPY model to predict Anthropometric measurements of fashion models from images.

## Dataset
The dataset of choice is [Model Agency Data](https://shapy.is.tue.mpg.de/datasets.html). This is a dataset collected by Choutas et al., for their paper - '[Accurate 3D Body Shape Regression using Metric and Semantic Attributes](https://shapy.is.tue.mpg.de/index.html)' 

**Model Agency Data**: Images and anthropometric measurements (height and chest/waist/hip circumference) of 4.4K models (95K images). A subset of 1.2K models (21K images) additionally have attribute annotations collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
