# Human_Body_Shape_Estimation
Trying to estimate Body Shape from 2D Human images.

## Dataset
The dataset of choice is [Model Agency Data](https://shapy.is.tue.mpg.de/datasets.html). This is a dataset collected by Choutas et al., for their paper - '[Accurate 3D Body Shape Regression using Metric and Semantic Attributes](https://shapy.is.tue.mpg.de/index.html)' 
**Model Agency Data**: Images and anthropometric meausrements (height and chest/waist/hip circumference) of 4.4K models (95K images). A subset of 1.2K models (21K images) additionally have attribute annotations collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
